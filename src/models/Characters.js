    historyLarge:"In the vast and far-reaching universe of Dragon Ball, one name stands out as a symbol of defiance and unyielding determination – Bardock, the legendary Saiyan warrior. Born on the distant planet Vegeta, Bardock's journey would take him from the ranks of a low-class Saiyan to a figure of enduring legend."+
    "Bardock's early life was marked by the brutal and ruthless nature of Saiyan society. As a low-class warrior, he was but a cog in the machine of the Saiyan empire, a race known for its conquests and subjugation of other planets. Bardock was part of a small team of elite warriors who undertook the most dangerous and challenging missions assigned by Frieza, the tyrant who ruled over the Saiyan race."+
    "However, Bardock's life took a dramatic turn when he received a vision of the future, a vision that would change the course of his life and the fate of the Saiyan race. In this haunting vision, Bardock saw the destruction of Planet Vegeta and the annihilation of the Saiyan people at the hands of Frieza. This glimpse into the future drove Bardock to confront the harsh reality+ of the Saiyan's role as ruthless conquerors and the impending doom that awaited them.",
